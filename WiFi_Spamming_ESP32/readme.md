# ESP32 WiFi Beacon Spammer
### An Educational Project for Understanding WiFi Beacon Frames


## üìù Description
This project demonstrates the creation and transmission of WiFi beacon frames using an ESP32 microcontroller. It simulates multiple WiFi networks by broadcasting customizable beacon frames, providing insights into WiFi protocols and network behavior.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Educational Purpose Only**: This project is intended for educational purposes to understand WiFi protocols. Using this code for malicious purposes or disrupting networks may be illegal in your jurisdiction.

## üöÄ Features
- Simulates up to 10 concurrent WiFi networks
- Real-time serial command interface
- Customizable network names (SSIDs)
- Random MAC address generation
- Interactive control system
- Low resource consumption

## üìã Prerequisites
### Hardware
- ESP32 Development Board
- USB Cable
- Computer for programming

### Software
- Arduino IDE (1.8.x or newer)
- ESP32 Board Support Package
- Serial Terminal (built-in Arduino IDE Serial Monitor or equivalent)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Project Setup**   
   ```bash
   # Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/ESP32-Work/ESP32-IOT.git
    ```

## üì§ Upload Instructions
1. Connect ESP32 to your computer
2. Select correct board and port 
3. Click upload button
4. Wait for compilation and upload to complete
5. Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)

## üíª Usage
### Serial Commands
```bash
start   - Begin broadcasting networks
stop    - Stop broadcasting
list    - Show all configured SSIDs
status  - Display current broadcasting status
set X Y - Set network X (0-9) to name Y
```

### Example Usage
```bash
# Start broadcasting
start

# List all networks
list

# Change network name
set 0 NewNetwork

# Check status
status

# Stop broadcasting
stop
```

## üîß Customization
### Modifying Default Networks
```cpp
char ssids[10][32] = {
    "Network_1",
    "Network_2",
    // Add more networks here
};
```

### Adjusting Timing
```cpp
// In loop() function
delay(1); // Modify delay between broadcasts
```

## üìä Technical Details
### Beacon Frame Structure
```bash
[Frame Control] [Duration] [Destination Addr] [Source Addr] [BSSID] [Sequence] [Timestamp] [Beacon Int] [Capability] [SSID]
```

### Memory Usage
- Packet Buffer: 128 bytes
- SSID Storage: 320 bytes (10 x 32)
- Variables: ~100 bytes
- Total: ~548 bytes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **ESP32 Not Detected**
   - Check USB connection
   - Verify correct board selection
   - Install/reinstall ESP32 board package

2. **Compilation Errors**
   - Verify ESP32 board package installation
   - Check Arduino IDE version compatibility
   - Ensure all required libraries are installed

3. **No Networks Appearing**
   - Confirm 'start' command was sent
   - Check serial monitor baud rate (115200)
   - Verify ESP32 initialization messages
